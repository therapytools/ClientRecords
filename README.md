# Progress Note Generator

A simple tool that converts **"in the moment"** notes written during a telehealth session into structured progress notes. These notes can be easily copied and pasted into an Electronic Health Record (EHR).  

All client data is stored **locally on your computer** to ensure security and privacy of records.

For HIPAA compliance, either utilize Open WebUI locally for note generation, or sign a BAA with Google Gemini or ChatGPT.
